# Notes
# - Description should be the English version of the text, unless English version is a shorthand e.g. Home button is shorthand in English for Homepage
# - Argumets can be added via {{.argN}} where N is integer index starting at 0 e.g. {{.arg0}} {{.arg1}}
# - To inject HTML (Avoid where possible as it is messy) use "| safeHTML" e.g. {{ localise Foo .Language 1 | safeHTML }} where Foo might be "<strong>test</strong>"
